# Chernihiv without Barriers (Чернігів без бар'єрів) - Hackathon Project Documentation

## Overview

"Chernihiv without Barriers" (Чернігів без бар'єрів) is a hackathon project aimed at creating a comprehensive and user-friendly map of accessible locations within the city of Chernihiv, Ukraine. This project addresses the critical need for individuals with disabilities, seniors, and parents with strollers to easily identify places that meet their accessibility requirements. By crowdsourcing and curating data on accessibility features, we strive to make Chernihiv a more inclusive and navigable city for everyone.

## Problem Statement

Navigating a city can be challenging for individuals with specific accessibility needs. Lack of information about ramps, elevators, accessible restrooms, and other crucial features often restricts their mobility and participation in community life. This project aims to solve this problem by providing a centralized and community-driven platform to discover and share information about accessible locations in Chernihiv.

## Solution

Our solution is a mobile application featuring an interactive map of Chernihiv. Key features include:

- **Interactive Map:** Displays accessible locations as markers on a map interface of Chernihiv.
- **Marker Details:** Tapping on a marker reveals detailed information about the location's accessibility features (e.g., ramp availability, elevator access, accessible parking, restroom facilities).
- **User Contribution:** Registered users can add new accessible locations to the map by dropping a marker and providing details about its accessibility features.
- **Filtering:** Users can filter locations based on specific accessibility criteria to find places that meet their individual needs.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication to enable contributions and potentially save preferred accessibility settings.
- **Multilingual Support:** The application includes support for multiple languages, including Ukrainian and potentially others.

## Technical Details

The mobile application is built using **React Native** with **Expo** for cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android).

### Key Technologies and Libraries:

- **Expo Router:** For navigation within the application.
- **Expo Status Bar:** For managing the status bar appearance.
- **React Native Maps:** For displaying the interactive map and markers.
- **React Native Paper:** For UI components (e.g., `IconButton`, `Text`, `TouchableRipple`, `AppBar`).
- **Context API (React):** For managing global state, such as user authentication (`UserContext`) and accessibility filters (`FiltersContext`).
- **`react-i18next`:** For internationalization (i18n) to support multiple languages.
- **`getMarkersArray` (Custom Utility):** A utility function (likely for initial development or testing) to generate an array of marker objects.

### File Breakdown:

The provided code snippet is from the **`Home.tsx`** file, which represents the main map screen of the application. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

- **Imports:** Imports necessary modules and components from various libraries.
- **`initialRegion`:** Defines the initial geographical coordinates and zoom level for the map centered on Chernihiv.
  ```latex
  initialRegion = \{
    latitude: 51.5012162, \\
    longitude: 31.29344, \\
    latitudeDelta: 0.06922, \\
    longitudeDelta: 0.06421, \\
  \}
  ```
- **`initMarkers`:** An array of initial marker data generated by the `getMarkersArray` function. This is likely placeholder data for development.
- **`Home` Functional Component:**
  - **`useTranslation("map")`:** Provides access to translated text specific to the map screen.
  - **`useContext(UserContext)`:** Accesses the user authentication state. If no user is logged in, the `LoginView` is displayed.
  - **`useContext(FiltersContext)`:** Accesses the currently selected accessibility filters.
  - **`useState(initMarkers)`:** Manages the state of the displayed map markers, initially set to the `initMarkers`.
  - **`useState<Region>(initialRegion)`:** Manages the state of the draggable marker, allowing users to select a location for adding a new marker. The `Region` type likely defines the latitude, longitude, and deltas.
  - **`useRouter()`:** Provides access to the Expo Router navigation object.
  - **`handleNavigate()`:** Navigates the user to the `submitMarker` screen, passing the coordinates of the currently dragged marker.
  - **`handleFilter()`:** Navigates the user to a modal screen (`/modal`) where they can apply accessibility filters.
  - **`useEffect(() => { ... }, [filters])`:** This hook updates the displayed markers whenever the `filters` state changes. It filters the `initMarkers` array to only include items whose `accessibilityLevel` is present in the `filters` array.
  - **Return Statement:** Renders the main UI of the map screen:
    - **`CustomSafeAreaView`:** A custom component likely providing platform-aware safe area handling.
    - **`AppBar`:** A component displaying the title of the screen (translated "map" text).
    - **`View style={styles.container}`:** The main container for the map and controls.
    - **`StatusBar`:** Manages the appearance of the device's status bar.
    - **`MapView`:** The interactive map component:
      - `zoomEnabled`: Allows users to zoom in and out.
      - `initialRegion`: Sets the initial map view.
      - **`<Marker draggable ...>`:** A draggable marker that users can move to select a location for adding a new accessible place. Its coordinates are updated in the `marker` state.
      - **`{markers.map(...) }`:** Iterates over the filtered `markers` array and renders a `Marker` component for each accessible location. Each marker has:
        - A unique `key`.
        - `coordinate` based on the marker's data.
        - `pinColor` potentially indicating the type of accessibility.
        - `title` providing a name for the location.
    - **`View style={{ ... }}`:** A container for the filter and add new marker buttons, arranged horizontally with even spacing.
    - **`TouchableRipple`:** Provides a touch feedback animation for the buttons.
    - **`IconButton`:** Displays icons for filtering and adding.
    - **`Text`:** Displays the translated labels for the buttons ("filter" and "addNewMarker").
- **`styles` StyleSheet:** Defines the styling for the components within the `Home` screen.

## Future Enhancements

- **Detailed Accessibility Information:** Expand the marker details to include more specific information about accessibility features (e.g., dimensions of doorways, availability of audio guides, hearing loops).
- **Categorization of Locations:** Implement categories for different types of accessible places (e.g., restaurants, shops, public transport stops, cultural institutions).
- **Search Functionality:** Allow users to search for specific locations or types of accessible places.
- **Routing and Navigation:** Integrate navigation features to provide accessible routes to selected locations.
- **Image Uploads:** Enable users to upload images to provide visual context for accessibility features.
- **Community Moderation:** Implement a system for community moderation to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data.
- **Accessibility Rating System:** Allow users to rate the accessibility of locations.
- **Offline Maps:** Consider implementing offline map capabilities for users with limited internet access.
- **Integration with External Data Sources:** Explore integrating with existing open data sources related to accessibility.
